ArcEmu is an Open Source World of Warcraft server, which is x86 compatible (including Pentium® and Athlon™), amd64 compatible, and PowerPC compatible. It is currently developed and maintained by a team of individuals. The server is written in C++ and offers advanced networking, performance, ingame anti-hack security, and unique features today which are still missing in other server software packages.

Arcemu is written in C++ delivering fast performance. At the heart of Arcemu is a multithreaded core, making the most of your processing hardware by running tasks in parallel whilst ensuring the most stringent controls are placed on inter-thread memory protection to offer superior stability.

The core also provides interfaces to other components such as our 3D collision detection module, high level scripting engine and reporting services module. Using component architecture, we are able to develop components independently of each other, so smaller groups of the Arcemu team can work on different components at the same time without compromising each other's work.

It is easy to contribute to ArcEmu. All you need to do is find a part of ArcEmu which you think could be improved and make changes (carefully and cleanly)then submit them back to the project by means of the forums. This could be anything from documentation, to source code. See the Contributing to ArcEmu article for more information.
ArcEmu has been tested under the following systems on 32bit and 64bit installations but should also compile under any system where GCC and autoconf are available.

Windows(XP or later)
Windows Server(2001 or later)

Ubuntu
